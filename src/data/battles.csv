The battle revived the morale of the Allies, being the first big success against the Axis since Operation Crusader in late 1941.

Hitler later blamed the failure of his invasion of the Soviet Union, which had to be delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece.[16] The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been either refuted or downplayed by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-163-0319-03A%2C_Griechenland%2C_deutsche_Infanterie_auf_dem_Marsch.jpg
